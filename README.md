The Peak Detector extension displays the depth position of the highest value within an averaged A-scan. This averaged A-scan is generated by averaging the A-scans within the user-changeable Region of Interest (ROI) within the B-scan.

This extension can be used as a basis for implementing more advanced OCT peak detection techniques.
